It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

            <h4 class="fw-bold">3. How Event-Loop works in JavaScript?</h4>
            <p> The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack(A Call Stack is simply nothing but a stack data structure where tasks or code is being executed accordingly,  in which the last element added is always the first to be removed from the stack). Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>
