            <h4 class="fw-bold"> 1. Differences between local storage and session storage.</h4>
            <p>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold">2. Differences between Global Scope and Block Scope.</h4>
            <p> Global Scope: In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed.</p>
            <p>Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.</p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold">3. How Event-Loop works in JavaScript?</h4>
            <p> The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack(A Call Stack is simply nothing but a stack data structure where tasks or code is being executed accordingly,  in which the last element added is always the first to be removed from the stack). Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>
